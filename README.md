# Building a guessing game in Rust

This repo started as the guessing game from Chapter 2 of The Book.
As I progress through the chapters, I'm adding new features and refactoring using the language features introduced.
Will be creating a series simple of 'AI' players to make guesses using different algorithms, including linear, jump, binary & other searches all to be compared to random guessing.
